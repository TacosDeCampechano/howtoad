      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Did you know that in terms of content editing, anyone can do it!? Yes, you heard right, anyone can edit and create their own content. do you need to promote your product? Do you want to do a fun presentation in a video format or just create content in video format? Well, YOU CAN DO IT, and is noting outside of this (Im not saying easy, but fun).

        Now days with YouTube, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram reel you can create your own content and show it to the world, for example, you want to promote your product and dont want to spend hundreds of dollars giving promotion of it on the internet? Well, you can do it for free!!! Creating and submitting content on the internet is “free” the only thing you need to do this is a camera, a phone or computer in this case and time, a lot of time… and creativity of course.

        For this tutorial we would start from the beginning, the recording, depends on what you want to record, if you want to record from a computer or phone is really simple, on the phone, go to your quick settings on the phone (both iOS and Android have this options is not exclusively from iOS, this is not 2014 guys) and just hit record
      </p>

      <p>
        For computers, OBS is the best option for both operating systems (macOS and Windows), is just simple like downloading and executing the program, but in case you are in windows then you can use the Xbox bar option to record (of course you won't have the same options and functions you can have with OBS, but it is easier to just hit and record if you are not doing something complex with your recording).
      </p>

      <p>
        In case you want to record your face or place you can use your phone or your camera, I don't need to explain how to record a video with your phone or camera because I am sure you had record something at one time in your entire life, don't lie to me bro.

          After you had your raw material ready to edit, we would go with the second or third part of this, the program, now for these we would be using Adobe products, in this case we are going to use Photoshop and Premiere Pro, now… I know this programs are ridiculously expensive, you have 3 options, try it for free and if you like then buy it, being an student and having an student account for it, or the last one, downloading from pages not so… well I think what I am talking about (and actually I know about a safe page where you can have this program but, not sure to share it he he…) now after you download the software and open it you would find it… quit interesting, don't alarm yourself, at first it would be not difficult but strange to understand, but believe, this is like learning math, ok maybe not the best example, but it is quite interesting to learn (not like math's, who likes math's?)
 
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where things get interesting, here you chose, what you want to learn first? Do you want to learn how to edit a photo, chose the left link, you want to learn how to edit a video, then click the right link, this is where you would learn how to edit, this can be difficult but not so much like math or programming a page, have fun editing.
