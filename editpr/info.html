          Welcome to my main page, here you can find and know a little bit about editing, in this case working on the premiere Pro editing type of knowledge, here you can find the basics of Premiere Pro and that you can apply it on other video editors, for example Filmora, DaVinci, PoweDirector between other editors, of course this is just the point of the iceberg, while time passes I would be refreshing the information (probably not) so everyone can have the knowledge to start in this called editing.

          But even if it is used in the entertainment industry you can learn how to used it (you can find this information on the internet or in my page).

          This software editing works perfectly to almost any type of format video, such as MP4 which is the most common, but also with MOV, FLV, AVI between other video formats.

          Also like other adobe products you can use them at the same time in the same project like Premiere Pro and After Effects. Giving more creativity and options to your proyect.

          Now that you have a better idea of what is Premiere Pro, you can check other options cause this application is very expensive, other options that are less expensive could be Filmora 11, and that it is easier to learn, other option could be DaVinci Resolve, but that is harder to learn, even harder than Premiere Pro itself.
