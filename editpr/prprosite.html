            learn the basics of Premiere Pro!! (not a complete Guide, they are not paying me for this :c)
        </h1>
        <h4>
            This is a start guide for Premiere Pro editing, you would read here about some tips and how to use your elements (video, images and sounds) correctly, Premiere Pro can be difficult to learn by your own, so having this page can help starting to editing, creators such as finzar or Rocklan are great for more advanced editing style, I really recommend this channels if you are really into more complex editing.
        </h4>
        <h2>
            Let's start with this, adding elements
        </h2>
        <p>
            So, after you created your first project in Premiere you should had a folder or two folders open and ready with the content you would use for your edit, I normally do this because while I work with the project I would add images and sound effects in the process, but in case you know what are the elements you are working with, just drag this elements to the elements section in the project.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Pro-Tip: <br> always have a folder open and ready to drag more elements to the project, you would eventually have more elements to the project.
        </h3>
        <h2>
            Cut and cut
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first thing you want to do on your project is to cut the video you are using, why of this? Simple, there are many parts on your video you would like to remove, now depending on the type of video you are trying to create you would need to cut more or less from the video, it depends on how long you want your video to be and what you are showing to the public. you can do this by selecting the option of cut found normally on the left of the timeline, or you can use shortcuts, using the keys C (cut) and V (select).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Pro tip: <br> prioritize those sections from the video where you are talking or doing something interesting, at the end you could play the video in then proyect the enough time you need until you think is ready for the next part
        </h3>
        <h2>
            Music
        </h2>
        <p>
            Music plays an important role in any video, music can improve a scene and also can would probably hold the viewer more time and involve them more in the situation, but for this of course you need to use music that can fit with the situation presented in your video, and other thing, copyright, you need to be sure the music you are using doesn't have copyright, because you can get in troubles if you use music that is not copyright free, and another thing, make sure to reduce the volume of your music in those moments where someone is talking, you can do this with the option of reduce or increase volume, just click the right buttom and select the option gain volume, with that option you can increase or decrease the volume of your audio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Pro Tip: <br> many videogames OST are copyright free music, you can try and work with it, of course if you are doing something more "serious" than simple youtube videos then you should consider compose your own music or in a better way, buy a music license, of course that means to spend money on it.
        </h3>
        <h2>
            Sound Effects
        </h2>
        <p>
            Similar to music, sound effects are really good to give more immersion in the video, and of course make them interesting, like music, sound effects should be considered for specific moments in the vdeo, if you use a sound effect that doesn't match with the situation of the video, it would make it awkard or simply it wouldn't fit in it, making the video feel strange for a moment, talking from experience with this, so be sure to use the adequate sound effect for the adequate moment.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Pro Tip: In youtube there is a channel called Gaming Sound FX, there is a great amount of sounds that you can use and are totally free.
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is everything I can talk about for the moment, is the most basic knowledge you should had to start editing in Premiere, of course Premiere and editing is something bigger than just adding music and clips, but is a good start to learn in the future.
